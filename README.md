## 🎯 Overview

The [SMS Backup & Restore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore&hl=en_US) app allows you to backup your entire SMS history, call logs, and contacts from Android devices. While the app provides an [online viewer](https://www.synctech.com.au/sms-backup-restore/view-backup/) for viewing backups, **exporting the actual data** from these backups can be challenging.

**This tool solves that problem** by providing a powerful, command-line utility to export data from SMS Backup & Restore archives. It can extract:

> **Note:** This application is based upon the original v1 concept and code from [@raleighlittles](https://github.com/raleighlittles) ([original repository](https://github.com/raleighlittles/SMS-backup-and-restore-extractor)) and has been greatly expanded and improved upon, with time and attention spend on code quality and tests. This version 2.0 represents a complete modernization with enhanced functionality and new features, better error handling, comprehensive testing, and modern Python tooling.

**Features include:**
- 📸 **Media files** from MMS messages (images, videos, audio, PDFs)
- 💬 **SMS/MMS text messages** exported to CSV files

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Get your backup files** from the Android app "SMS Backup & Restore":
   - SMS backups: `sms-*.xml` files
   - Call logs: `calls-*.xml` files
   - Contacts: `*.vcf` files

2. **Extract MMS media from SMS backup XML files**:
   ```bash
   uv run xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-media -i ~/backups -o ~/extracted_media
   ```

3. **Extract SMS/MMS text messages**:
   ```bash
   uv run xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-text -i ~/backups -o ~/messages
   ```

4. **Generate call log**:
   ```bash
   uv run xml-backup-exporter -t calls -i ~/backups -o ~/call_logs
   ```

5. **Extract contact media**:
   ```bash
   uv run xml-backup-exporter -t vcf -i ~/backups -o ~/contact_media
   ```

---

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Command Syntax

```bash
uv run xml-backup-exporter [-h] -t BACKUP_TYPE -i INPUT_DIR -o OUTPUT_DIR [OPTIONS]
```

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-h, --help` | Show help message and exit |
| `-t, --backup-type` | Type of extraction: `sms-mms-media`, `sms-mms-text`, `calls`, or `vcf` |
| `-i, --input-dir` | Directory containing XML or VCF files (can also be a single file) |
| `-o, --output-dir` | Directory where extracted files will be saved |
| `--no-images` | Don't extract image files (SMS only) |
| `--no-videos` | Don't extract video files (SMS only) |
| `--no-audio` | Don't extract audio files (SMS only) |
| `--no-pdfs` | Don't extract PDF files (SMS only) |

### Input Path Formats

The tool accepts various path formats for maximum flexibility:

```bash
# Relative directory
-i ./local/

# Relative file (uses parent directory automatically)
-i ./local/sms.xml

# Home directory expansion
-i ~/backups/

# Absolute path
-i /Users/username/Documents/backups

# Current directory
-i .
```

> **Note:** If you specify a file path, the program will automatically use its parent directory.

### Output Directory

The output directory will be **automatically created** if it doesn't exist. You don't need to create it beforehand.

## 📝 Examples

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand examples</b></summary>

### Extract All MMS Media

Extract all MMS media attachments (images, videos, audio, and PDFs) from SMS backup XML files:

```bash
uv run xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-media -i ~/backups -o ~/extracted_media
```

### Extract Only Videos

Extract only video files from MMS messages, excluding images, audio, and PDFs:

```bash
uv run xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-media -i ~/backups -o ~/videos \
  --no-images --no-audio --no-pdfs
```

### Extract Images and PDFs Only

```bash
uv run xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-media -i ~/backups -o ~/media \
  --no-videos --no-audio
```

### Generate Call Log CSV

Create a deduplicated call log from all call backup files:

```bash
uv run xml-backup-exporter -t calls -i ~/backups -o ~/call_logs
```

The output will be a file named `call_log.csv` in the output directory.

### Extract SMS/MMS Text Messages

Extract all SMS text messages and MMS text bodies to a CSV file:

```bash
uv run xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-text -i ~/backups -o ~/messages
```

The output will be a file named `sms_messages.csv` in the output directory.

### Extract Contact Media from VCF

Extract photos, sounds, logos, and keys from contact backup files:

```bash
uv run xml-backup-exporter -t vcf -i ~/backups -o ~/contact_media
```

### Using a Single File as Input

The tool automatically detects if you provide a file instead of a directory:

```bash
uv run xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-media -i ~/backups/sms-20231219.xml -o ~/output
# Note: Will use ~/backups/ as the input directory
```

### Alternative Execution Methods

If you installed with `pip install -e .`:

```bash
# Direct command (no 'uv run' needed)
xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-media -i ~/backups -o ~/output
```

Or run as a Python module:

```bash
# Using Python directly
python -m src.xml_backup_exporter -t sms-mms-media -i ~/backups -o ~/output

# Using uv with Python module
uv run python -m src.xml_backup_exporter -t sms-mms-media -i ~/backups -o ~/output
```

## 📊 Output Format

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand output format details</b></summary>

### SMS/MMS Media Files

**Note:** The `sms-mms-media` export type extracts media attachments from MMS messages contained in SMS backup XML files. Regular SMS messages don't contain media attachments, so only MMS message media is extracted.

- **Filename preservation**: If the original MMS message included a filename, it will be used
- **Auto-naming**: If no filename exists, a random 10-character filename will be generated
- **Duplicate handling**: Duplicate files are automatically removed
- **Empty file removal**: Empty files are automatically removed
- **File safety**: Long filenames are automatically shortened to prevent filesystem issues

### SMS/MMS Text Messages CSV Format

The `sms_messages.csv` file contains the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `Message Type` | Message type | `SMS` or `MMS` |
| `Date (timestamp)` | Unix timestamp in milliseconds | `1511043340171` |
| `Date` | Human-readable date | `"Nov 18, 2017 5:15:40 PM"` |
| `Address` | Phone number or address | `+15137392992` |
| `Contact Name` | Contact name | `John Doe` |
| `Type` | Message direction | `1` (incoming) or `2` (outgoing) |
| `Body` | Message text content | `"Hello, how are you?"` |
| `Read` | Read status | `1` (read) or `0` (unread) |
| `Status` | Message status | `0` (normal) |
| `Locked` | Locked status | `0` (unlocked) or `1` (locked) |
| `SIM ID` | SIM slot identifier | `1`, `2`, etc. |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand troubleshooting guide</b></summary>

### Common Issues

#### "Input directory does not exist"

**Problem:** The specified input directory doesn't exist.

**Solution:** Check that the path is correct and use `-i` with an existing directory:
```bash
# Verify the directory exists
ls ~/backups

# Use the correct path
uv run xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-media -i ~/backups -o ~/output
```

#### "No calls found to write to call log"

**Problem:** No matching XML files found in the input directory.

**Solution:** 
- Ensure your call backup files start with `calls` and have `.xml` extension
- Check that files are in the correct directory
- Verify file naming: `calls-20231219.xml`, `calls.xml`, etc.

#### "FileNotFoundError" or path-related errors

**Problem:** Path format issues.

**Solution:** Try using absolute paths or ensure relative paths are correct:
```bash
# Use absolute path
uv run xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-media -i /full/path/to/backups -o /full/path/to/output

# Or navigate to the directory first
cd ~/backups
uv run xml-backup-exporter -t sms-mms-media -i . -o ../output
```

#### Python version issues

**Problem:** Incompatible Python version.

**Solution:** Ensure you're using Python 3.8 or higher:
```bash
python3 --version  # Should show 3.8 or higher
```

#### Missing dependencies

**Problem:** Import errors or missing packages.

**Solution:** Reinstall dependencies:
```bash
# Using uv
uv sync

# Using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the error message** - It often contains helpful information
2. **Verify your file format** - Ensure your backup files match expected formats
3. **Include backup date** - If reporting an issue, include when your backup was generated
4. **Check file permissions** - Ensure you have read access to input files and write access to output directory
