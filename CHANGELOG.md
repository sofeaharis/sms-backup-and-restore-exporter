## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-18

### Changed
- **Code formatting** - Applied consistent formatting across all source files using `ruff format`
- **Type safety improvements** - Fixed all type errors and added proper type annotations
  - Fixed `Optional[str]` type for `output_dir` parameter in `call_log_generator.py`
  - Converted `Message ID` fields to strings for consistency in CSV output
  - Added proper type annotations using `Dict[str, Any]`, `Callable`, and `Union` types
  - Fixed `callable` type hint to use `typing.Callable` for mypy compatibility
- **Removed unused imports** - Cleaned up `sys` and `time` imports in `mms_media_extractor.py` (they were actually needed, restored)
- **Python 3.8 compatibility** - Fixed f-string syntax to avoid nested quote issues for Python 3.8 support

### Added
- **Type checking** - Integrated `mypy` for static type checking with full type coverage
- **Type stubs** - Installed `types-requests` and `lxml-stubs` for complete type checking support
- **Code quality tools** - All source files now pass `ruff check` and `mypy` validation

### Fixed
- Fixed f-string quote reuse issue in `get_human_readable_duration()` for Python 3.8 compatibility
- Resolved all type annotation errors reported by mypy

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **SMS/MMS text message extraction** - New `sms-text` export type extracts all SMS text messages and MMS text bodies to CSV
- **Enhanced call log fields** - Added read status, SIM slot, and call features to call log CSV output
- **Memory-efficient XML parsing** - Upgraded call log generator to use `lxml.etree.iterparse()` for better performance and memory efficiency
- **New module**: `sms_text_extractor.py` for extracting SMS/MMS text content
- **Comprehensive VCF field parsing** - Full support for all vCard fields including birthdays, notes, and other metadata
- **Comprehensive test suite** - Added tests for SMS/MMS text extraction (`test_sms_text_extractor.py`)
- **Enhanced test coverage** - Updated call log tests to verify new fields (Read status, SIM slot, Features)
- **CLI testing** - Added test for `sms-text` option in `test_xml_backup_exporter.py`

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed command from `backup-extractor` to `xml-backup-exporter`
- **BREAKING**: Renamed main module from `backup_extractor.py` to `xml_backup_exporter.py`
- **Improved XML parsing**: Call log generator now uses `lxml.etree.iterparse()` instead of `xml.etree.ElementTree` for consistency and performance
- Updated README with detailed description acknowledging original work by @raleighlittles
- Added credits throughout source code and documentation
- Updated CLI to support new `sms-text` backup type
- Enhanced documentation across all source files:
  - Added module docstrings explaining purpose and functionality
  - Improved function docstrings with Args, Returns, and Examples
  - Added usage examples in docstrings where helpful
  - Better code comments for maintainability

### Changed (from Unreleased)
- **Refactored vCard/VCF parser** for improved maintainability and code quality
  - Replaced long if/elif chain with dispatch dictionary pattern
  - Improved error handling (replaced `sys.exit()` with proper exceptions)
  - Removed debug print statements, kept essential status messages
  - Better code organization with helper functions and clear separation of concerns
  - Enhanced type hints and documentation
  - Improved variable naming and code style

### Fixed
- Fixed potential index errors in multiline multimedia parsing
- Better error messages for malformed VCF files

## [2.0.0] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- Modern `pyproject.toml` configuration for uv and pip package management
- `.gitignore` file with comprehensive Python project exclusions
- Entry point script `xml-backup-exporter` for easy command-line usage
- Improved error handling with clear messages for missing directories
- Support for `uv` tooling as the primary package manager
- Dependency groups configuration using modern `[dependency-groups]` format
- `__init__.py` file in `src/` for proper package structure
- Path normalization to handle various input formats (`./local/`, `../parent/`, `~/backups/`, relative/absolute paths)
- Support for specifying input as either a directory or a single file (automatically uses parent directory if a file is provided)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Moved all Python code to `src/` directory following modern Python project structure (src-layout)
- **BREAKING**: Changed imports from absolute (`src.module`) to relative (`.module`) imports
- Updated `call_log_generator.create_call_log()` to accept and use `output_dir` parameter instead of always writing to current directory
- Modernized code style (removed unnecessary parentheses around conditionals)
- Improved README with clearer usage instructions and multiple installation/execution methods
- Updated build system to use hatchling with proper package configuration
- Enhanced path handling: input now accepts directories or files (auto-detects parent directory if file is specified)
- Improved path flexibility: supports relative paths (`./local/`), parent directories (`../parent/`), home directory expansion (`~/backups/`), and absolute paths

### Fixed
- Fixed critical bug in `contacts_vcard_extractor.py` where `key` variable was undefined in list comprehension (line 27)
- Fixed `call_log_generator.py` to write output to specified directory instead of current working directory
- Added proper error handling for missing input directories in all extraction functions
- Improved CSV writing with `newline=''` parameter for cross-platform compatibility
- Fixed entry point configuration in `pyproject.toml`

### Removed
- Removed deprecated `mms_images_extractor.py` file (replaced by `mms_media_extractor.py`)
- Removed old `backup_extractor.py` from project root (moved to `src/`)

### Documentation
- Updated README with modern installation instructions for uv
- Added multiple usage examples with clear path placeholders
- Documented alternative execution methods (uv run, python -m, pip install -e)

### Contributors
- Rich Lewis - GitHub: @RichLewis007 - Modernized project structure, fixed bugs, and updated tooling
